Hello friend!!! Here, we'll show you how to navagate this text-based menu as well as play the game!

Instructions for the menu:

    "back" to go back a menu (going back from here will take you to the main menu!)

    "end" will terminate the program

    In other menus, there are different options to press. Type the text on the screen in order to access that option / submenu

Instructions for the game:

    Your goal as a player is to transfer cards from their starting position to the card foundation piles. 

    If you do this and observe all the solitaire game rules, you win this game. Here are the rules of playing solitaire.

    You can only move cards from one pile to another while observing the specific solitaire rules
        For instance, one can move a 6 on top of a 7 or a Queen on top of a King.
    Players have to arrange cards in alternating colors. E.g., if the above card is red, the other must be black.

    Moving a card from one pile to the next frees up the next face-down card.

    You should fill foundations in ascending order and ensure that they match the appropriate suit. 
        E.g., two of hearts can only go on top of ace of hearts, followed by three of hearts.

    A vacancy will be created by moving an entire row to other positions to create an empty tableau.

    Only a king can be moved to an empty tableau

How to input:
    
    "d" will reveal the next card in the draw pile

    move [x][z] [y]
        x is where you're taking the cards from (like d for draw, a for acestack, and 0-6 for the appropriate board stacks)
        z is the amount of cards you are taking if x represents a board stack. z is which ace pile (0-3) if x is "a"
        y is where you're moving the cards to (like 0-6 for another boardstack, a for acestack, and 0-4 for the appropriate ace stacks)

    "r" will reset the board

    "q" will quit the game
